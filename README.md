#  Hogwarts School Database Project (PL/SQL)
## Project Overview
This project simulates the database structure and operations for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, using PL/SQL. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in database design, SQL, and PL/SQL programming by implementing complex database queries and procedures to manage school-related data.

### The database includes tables for:

- Students
- Professors
- Courses
- Houses
- Spells
- House Points
- Clubs
- Wands
- Teams
- Various PL/SQL blocks, functions, and procedures have been written to handle operations such as calculating grades, adding new textbooks, and determining the winner of the House Cup.

## Project Highlights
- Database Design: Structured data to model Hogwarts' various entities (students, courses, houses, etc.).
- SQL and PL/SQL: Implemented several PL/SQL scripts for data retrieval, manipulation, and reporting.
- Stored Procedures and Functions: Created reusable code blocks for tasks such as calculating average grades and summarizing student statistics.
- Triggers: Automated logging of salary changes and student graduation records.
- Cursors: Used to iterate over large data sets to perform calculations and summaries.
##Technologies Used
- Oracle PL/SQL
- SQL
## Key Operations
- Salary Increase Simulation: Show a 15% salary increase for all professors and display the new salaries without making permanent changes.
- House Statistics: Provide statistics (total students, gender ratio, average age) for a given Hogwarts house.
- Student Reunion List: Generate a list of students, their current age, and their age in 10 years for the Hogwarts 10-year reunion.
- Wand Assignment: Retrieve details about each studentâ€™s wand, including wood type, core type, and length.
- House Cup Award: Determine and award the House Cup to the house with the most points earned throughout the school year.
- Graduation Tracker: Automatically log and track students graduating based on age, and clear their data from the main student table.
### File Contents
- Hogwarts_Database_Project.pdf: Contains the full documentation of the project, including SQL/PL-SQL scripts and sample outputs.
### SQL Scripts for:
